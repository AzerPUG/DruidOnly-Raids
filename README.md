# Pre-Info, before you read.
- This event will be on ***Alliance-EU***, you are not able to join otherwise!
- Event takes place on 19/06/2021, 19:00 Server Time!
- Registration Deadline: June 12th (Must meet all requirements already!)

# Druid Only Raids, by AzerPUG (Tex).
Back in Cataclysm, I was raiding with a Druid Only guild. We struggled, because we were missing immunites and so many class buffs. But we enjoyed the challenge and even had some status on the server because of it. We had hardcore raiders (that happened to be Druids) joining sometimes for fun, or helping by coaching us and theorycrafting with us.  
Ever since I left them (and the server) for more progression, something in me missed that fun, of being a full Druid only raid.  
To add a bit of Class Fantasy, we are only taking in Night Fae Druids. Us tree huggers should stick together ;)
  
So here we are. Back again into Druid only mode. Organizing a Druid only raid, for the fun of it.  
Although this is currently the very first, if this is actually fun and we get enough people together, this could become a thing we do once or twice per patch!  

### *If you want to sponsor or promote the event/charity, please, contact Tex#1991 on Discord for more info!*

# Rules.
As an AzerPUG event, all AzerPUG standard rules would apply. Any other rules will be put in this document, to make it as accessible as possible for everyone involved.
The AzerPUG rules can be found on our website: https://www.azerpug.com/  
By participating in this event, you automatically agree to **ALL** the AzerPUG rules, as well as the rules set in this document.  
And just to be sure, as it probably has to be said for ***someone***:  
This is not your event. You do not make the rules. You are not in charge. You are not the Raid Leader. 
We do not care...
- ...how much you disagree.
- ...how smart you think are.
- ...how much experience you have.
- ...how big dick numbers you can do.

# Pre-Event Meeting.
It is mandatory to have a meeting with Tex, the Raid Leader, somewhere in the week before the event. This meeting is to make sure you know the AddOns and have them prepared. That you are up to date with our rules. That you have your character (almost) fully prepped. And to answer any questions you might have, still.  
There will also be a general meeting of the Druids. This general meeting will also talk over the important things and may count as your mandatory meeting with Tex!
We strongly suggest you to attend this meeting, but it is not mandatory. This meeting will be June 12th, 2021, at 19:00 Server Time, in the AzerPUG Discord. It should last under an hour, but as with (almost) all our events, we often have people sticking around longer afterwards, which you are more than welcome to do as well!

# Filming and Streaming.
The event will be streamed on the offical AzerPUG Twitch. A video will be created and put on the official AzerPUG YouTube after wards as well.  
This will also be a charity event, for Doctors Without Borders / Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), through Tiltify. 
Due to this, and to prevent 'competing' with our official channels during the Charity Event, you are NOT allowed to stream / record the event.  
Joining this event, means you automatically agree to this! (this is also a standard AzerPUG rule).

# AddOns.
AzerPUG has several mandatory AddOns. For this event, these will also be mandatory, to make sure everything goes as smooth as we normaly try to have our raids.  
The use of all these AddOns, the settings you will need and why they are mandatory will be explained, in detail, during the pre-event meeting! Although not mandatory like the other AddOns, we urge you to also get the AzerPUG's Core AddOn. The Core will improve the performance of all our other AddOns, especially when using more than one.

# Requirements.
To make sure that the event does not become a wipefest, we have to put some boundaries and requirements. These requirements are low, if not a bit too low. But should be easily obtainable by anyone who wants to join. If you need help in making these requirements, the AzerPUG community can maybe help you out! Join our Discord (see the website link above) and come have a chat with us! (You will need to join the Discord anyway, for the event itself!)

### Discord.
Being on Discord during and for the entire event, is mandatory. We want to be able to communicate. It is not a problem if you do not have a mic, althought it is strongly preferred. But at least hearing your Raid Leaders when they are talking will help out a lot!

### Gear.
- Item Level 187+.
- Legendary Rank 1+. (that is applicable for your spec).
- All gear Enchanted, where possible.
- All gear Gemmed, where possible. (Sockets filled, not the Venari upgrade).

### Experience.
We will not be explaining every litle detail of every single boss and thus we do not want you to be raiding on your Druid for the first time. To make sure everyone has at least some what an idea what they are doing, we expect every one to be 10/10NM on their Druid, before the Druid Only Raid!  
However, do not fear, AzerPUG has your back! Every Tuesday, from 19:00 - 22:00 Server Time, we do a Normal Teaching Raid. You can join this with a priority spot if you need to get those bosses down for the event. Although we never promise how much we can kill, we more often kill 10/10NM + 1/10HC, then anything less.

### Talents.
We are fans of 'let people play what they want', but also of 'efficiency' and 'minmaxing'. To make sure we optimize at least a lot of passives, we have a few enforced talents.
- Renewal. The 'Oh Shit' button your healers will not have, on a 90s CoolDown. (Restoration / Balance / Feral).
- Restoration Affinity. Ysera's Gift all the way, but also the ability to help out healing when needed. (Guardian, Balance, Feral).
- Guardian Affinity. Since we can not choose RestoAff as Resto, we will go with Damage Reduction, plus several extra tanks when needed! (Restoration).
- Heart of the Wild. Making your Affinity choice stronger gives us all the things we want, but stronger! (Restoration / Guardian / Balance / Feral).

### Consumables.
- 3 Flasks (2 for Alchemysts).
- 3 Weapon Mods.
- 2 Armor Kits.
- 20 Potions. (Applicable for your role).  
Feasts will be provided, if you rather eat personal food, bring at least 20!
